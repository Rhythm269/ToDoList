# ToDoList
Developed a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Framework, and JavaScript.
Users can input the Title and Description of the note and add it to the list.
They also have an option to clear the entire list.
Data is stored, fetched, and displayed using local storage.
Users have the option to add or delete a row from the list.
A navigation bar is added to the list which can be edited to suit the users' purpose by adding different functionality.
